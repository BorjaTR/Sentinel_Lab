notes: |
  Largest liquid staking protocol with 24.4% of all staked ETH.
  Revenue = 5% of ~$711M annual staking rewards (~$35.5M annual, $2.95M monthly).
  Spending decreased from $190M (2021) to ~$46M (2025).
  71% of treasury in LDO tokens.
  Dual Governance implemented July 2025 - major protocol upgrade.
  Slightly deficit but manageable with discretionary cost cuts possible.
