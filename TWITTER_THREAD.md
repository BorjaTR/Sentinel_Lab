# Twitter Thread: Real Protocol Sustainability Analysis

Use this thread to announce Sentinel with real findings from analyzing 5 major protocols.

## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
I analyzed the financial sustainability of 5 major crypto protocols.

The results are worse than I expected.

0% are in healthy financial condition. One is critical.

Here's what I found 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (The Tool):**
```
I built Sentinel - a sustainability rating system for crypto protocols.

Like a credit score, but for DAOs, L2s, and DeFi.

One number (0-100) that tells you: will this protocol survive?

Open source methodology: github.com/BorjaTR/Sentinel_Lab
```

**Tweet 3 (Rankings Teaser):**
```
The results (Sentinel Score out of 100):

🟡 Aave: 63/100 (C)
🟡 Lido: 59/100 (C)
🔴 Arbitrum: 47/100 (D)
🔴 Uniswap: 45/100 (D)
🚨 Optimism: 31/100 (F) - CRITICAL

Average: 49/100

Not a single protocol scored "Healthy" (70+).
```

**Tweet 4 (Optimism - Most Concerning):**
```
Most concerning: Optimism

Score: 31/100 (F - CRITICAL)
Runway: 17 months

The problem:
→ Revenue: $3.2M/month
→ Costs: $18.5M/month
→ Deficit: -$15.3M/month

At current spend, they hit zero by April 2026.

81% goes to RPGF (Retro Public Goods Funding).
```

**Tweet 5 (Uniswap - The Paradox):**
```
The Uniswap paradox:

→ $4.4B treasury (largest DAO)
→ $170B+ monthly trading volume
→ Protocol revenue: $0

Why? The fee switch has NEVER been turned on.

Score: 45/100 (D)
Runway: 738 months

Massive treasury masks unsustainable model.
```

**Tweet 6 (Arbitrum - Incentive Trap):**
```
Arbitrum DAO: The incentive trap

Score: 47/100 (D)
Runway: 88 months

$2M/month revenue vs $11M/month costs.

73% of spending ($8M/mo) goes to incentive programs.

Post-EIP4844, sequencer margins improved 25% → 80%.
But spending hasn't adjusted.
```

**Tweet 7 (Aave - Best, But...):**
```
Aave scores highest: 63/100 (C)

Why not higher?

Revenue: $5M/month (interest spread, GHO, flash loans)
Costs: $6.8M/month

The deficit? $4M/month token buyback program.

Without buybacks: profitable
With buybacks: -$1.8M/month

Good problem to have.
```

**Tweet 8 (Lido - Tight Margins):**
```
Lido: 59/100 (C)

Nearly break-even:
→ Revenue: $2.95M/month (5% of staking rewards)
→ Costs: $3.9M/month
→ Deficit: -$950K/month

24.4% of all staked ETH.
Spending down from $190M (2021) to $46M (2025).

Sustainable, but no margin for error.
```

**Tweet 9 (Methodology):**
```
How Sentinel Score works:

• Runway (40%): Months until insolvency
• Sustainability (30%): Revenue ÷ costs
• Diversification (20%): Concentration risk
• Trajectory (10%): Improving or declining

All 5 protocols failed sustainability (0/30 points).
All 5 are unprofitable.
```

**Tweet 10 (The Blue Ocean Feature):**
```
But here's the game-changer:

You can model proposals BEFORE voting.

sentinel proposal dao.yaml --add-cost "Grant: 2000000"

Shows exact runway impact.

No more $100M grants passing without financial modeling.

This is what delegates need.
```

**Tweet 11 (Call to Action):**
```
Full protocol configs + methodology:
→ github.com/BorjaTR/Sentinel_Lab

Want your protocol scored? The tool is free and open source.

DAO delegates: DMs open if you want detailed analysis before major votes.

@arbitrum @Optimism @Uniswap @aave @LidoFinance
```

**Tweet 12 (The Ask):**
```
If you're a protocol team, delegate, or governance participant:

What would make this more useful?

- Historical tracking?
- Automated on-chain data?
- Proposal impact reports?
- Integration with Snapshot/Tally?

Building in public. Feedback welcome.

## Engagement Strategy

**After posting:**

1. Reply to your own thread with a chart/graphic showing:
   - The 5 scores in a bar chart
   - "0% Healthy" stat
   - "80% Warning" stat

2. Quote-tweet with specific protocol insights:
   - Tag Optimism with their 17-month finding
   - Tag Arbitrum with incentive analysis
   - Tag Uniswap with the $0 revenue paradox

3. Engage with protocol communities:
   - Find recent governance proposals
   - Reply with: "Ran this through Sentinel - here's the runway impact..."

4. Target key people:
   - DAO delegates with large voting power
   - Governance researchers
   - Protocol analysts
   - Treasury management teams

## Follow-up Content

**48 hours later:**
```
Update: Ran detailed analysis on Optimism's sustainability.

If RPGF spending continues at current rate:
→ Treasury depletes by Q2 2026
→ Even at 50% reduced spend: 34 months

But there's a path to profitability... 🧵
```

**1 week later:**
```
Built a tool that models Arbitrum's path to profitability.

Tested 12 scenarios.

The winner: Reduce incentives to $4M/mo + grow sequencer revenue 20%

Result: Break-even in 8 months.

## Important Notes

1. **Be factual, not alarmist**: Use "at risk" not "doomed"
2. **Cite sources**: Link to your data sources
3. **Offer solutions**: Don't just criticize, show the path forward
4. **Stay neutral**: No protocol favoritism
5. **Be helpful**: Respond to questions with analysis, not selling

## If Protocols Push Back

**Response template:**
```
All data is from public sources [links].

If any numbers are incorrect, I'll update immediately and rerun the analysis.

The configs are open source - you can verify every assumption.

Happy to hop on a call to review the methodology.
```

## What Success Looks Like

Within 30 days:
- 3+ DAO delegates using Sentinel for proposal analysis
- 1+ protocol requesting detailed sustainability audit
- Governance forum citations ("per Sentinel Score...")
- Integration requests from governance tooling

This is how you go from "built a tool" to "set the standard".
