notes: |
  Illustrative lending protocol economics showing:
  - Multiple revenue streams (interest, liquidations, flash loans)
  - Significant liquidity incentives (user acquisition)
  - Strong treasury diversification (multiple stables)
  - Profitable but with high discretionary costs
  - Security-focused (insurance, audits, risk management)
