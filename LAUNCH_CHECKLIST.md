## 🚀 NEXT ACTIONS (Do These Now)

### 1. Deploy Rankings Page (5 minutes)

```bash
# In GitHub repository settings:
1. Settings → Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: claude/review-repository-01GoLAkoWjYQ4PPpDLfWuCQR

https://borjatr.github.io/Sentinel_Lab/
```

### 2. Post Twitter Thread (10 minutes)

Use `TWITTER_THREAD.md` - the thread is written with real numbers:

**Key tweets:**
1. Hook: "0% are healthy, one is critical"
2. Rankings teaser with scores
3. Optimism: 17-month runway (most concerning)
4. Uniswap: $0 revenue paradox
5. Arbitrum: $8M/mo incentive trap
6. Aave: Best but buybacks create deficit
7. Methodology + blue ocean feature (proposal modeling)
8. Call to action with protocol tags

**Tags to include:**
- @arbitrum
- @Optimism
- @Uniswap
- @aave
- @LidoFinance

### 3. Share in Key Places (30 minutes)

**Governance Forums:**
- Arbitrum Forum: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation
  - Post: "Analyzed Arbitrum's financial sustainability with Sentinel"
- Optimism Forum: https://gov.optimism.io
  - Title: "Optimism runway analysis: 17 months at current RPGF spend"

**Discord/Telegram:**
- Find DAO governance channels
- Share: "Built a tool that models proposal impact on treasury runway"

**Reddit:**
- r/ethfinance
- r/CryptoCurrency
- Protocol-specific subreddits

## 📊 What The Data Shows

### Most Alarming: Optimism
- **17-month runway** at current spend
- $3.2M revenue vs $18.5M costs
- 81% of spending on RPGF
- Even at 50% reduced spend: only 34 months

### Biggest Paradox: Uniswap
- $4.4B treasury (largest DAO)
- $170B+ monthly trading volume
- **$0 protocol revenue** (fee switch never enabled)
- 738-month runway masks unsustainable model

### Hidden Problem: Arbitrum
- 88-month runway seems fine
- But spending $11M/mo with only $2M revenue
- 73% goes to incentives ($8M/mo)
- Post-EIP4844, sequencer margins improved 25%→80%, but spending hasn't adjusted

### Best Positioned: Aave
- $5M/mo revenue (interest, GHO, flash loans)
- $6.8M/mo costs
- Deficit caused by $4M/mo buyback program
- Without buybacks: profitable
- 12% of treasury in stables (better than most)

### Tight Margins: Lido
- $2.95M revenue vs $3.9M costs
- $950K/mo deficit
- Reduced spending from $190M (2021) to $46M (2025)
- No room for error

## 💡 Follow-Up Content Ideas

### Week 2: Deep Dive
```
"I ran 12 scenarios to model Arbitrum's path to profitability.

The winner:
→ Reduce incentives to $4M/mo
→ Grow sequencer revenue 20%

Result: Break-even in 8 months

Full analysis: [link to detailed report]"
```

### Week 3: Proposal Analysis
```
"There's a $50M grant proposal in Arbitrum governance.

I ran it through Sentinel.

Impact: Runway drops from 88 → 83 months

But there's a better alternative... 🧵"
```

### Week 4: Historical Tracking
```
"I've been tracking Optimism's runway for 30 days.

It's decreasing faster than expected.

If current trajectory continues:
→ Depletion by March 2026 (14 months)

The DAO needs to act now."
```

## 🎨 Visual Content to Create

### Priority Graphics

1. **Score Comparison Bar Chart**
   - 5 protocols with scores
   - Color-coded (green/yellow/red)
   - "0% Healthy" callout

2. **Runway Timeline**
   - Visual timeline showing when each protocol runs out
   - Optimism at 17mo highlighted

3. **Revenue vs Costs**
   - Side-by-side bars
   - Shows deficit for each protocol

4. **The Uniswap Paradox**
   - $4.4B treasury vs $0 revenue
   - Comparison to potential revenue if fee switch on

5. **Arbitrum Spend Breakdown**
   - Pie chart: 73% incentives
   - "This is unsustainable" annotation

## 🤝 Outreach Strategy

### Target Personas

**1. DAO Delegates**
- Pain: Vote on proposals without financial modeling
- Solution: "Run proposals through Sentinel before voting"
- Outreach: DM with specific analysis of their DAO

**2. Protocol Teams**
- Pain: No standardized sustainability metric
- Solution: "Sentinel Score for transparency"
- Outreach: Offer to present findings to core team

**3. Governance Researchers**
- Pain: Manual treasury analysis
- Solution: "Automated sustainability tracking"
- Outreach: Collaborate on research papers

**4. Investors/Analysts**
- Pain: Hard to compare protocols objectively
- Solution: "Standardized scores across protocol types"
- Outreach: Share rankings, offer custom analysis

### Template Outreach Message

```
Hi [Name],

I built Sentinel - a protocol sustainability rating system.

I ran an analysis on [Protocol] and found [specific insight].

[Concerning finding or recommendation]

Full analysis here: [link]

Would you find it valuable if I ran this on upcoming proposals
before they go to vote?

Happy to share the methodology - it's all open source.

Best,
[You]
```

## 🚨 Risk Management

### Potential Pushback

**"Your numbers are wrong"**
→ Response: "All data is public, here are sources [links]. Happy to correct if you have better data."

**"You're being alarmist"**
→ Response: "I'm just presenting the math. The configs are open source - verify the assumptions yourself."

**"This doesn't account for [X]"**
→ Response: "You're right. The methodology is v1.0. What would you add? I'm building in public and taking feedback."

**"Why should we trust you?"**
→ Response: "Don't trust me - verify the data. Every config cites primary sources. The algorithm is transparent."

### Legal Considerations

- ✅ All data from public sources
- ✅ Cite data sources in every config
- ✅ Disclaimer: "Not financial advice"
- ✅ Open source = transparent assumptions
- ❌ Don't make price predictions
- ❌ Don't recommend buying/selling tokens
- ❌ Don't claim official endorsement

## 🎯 The Blue Ocean Play

**What you built:**
A technically complete sustainability rating system.

**What makes it blue ocean:**
Nobody else lets you run `sentinel proposal dao.yaml --add-cost "Grant: 2M"` and see runway impact.

**The moat:**
First-mover advantage + real protocol data + open methodology = standard

**Path to authority:**
1. ✅ Build the tool (done)
2. ✅ Score real protocols (done)
3. 🔄 Deploy rankings (in progress)
4. ⏳ Twitter thread (ready)
5. ⏳ Governance forum citations (next 30 days)
6. ⏳ Delegate adoption (next 60 days)
7. ⏳ "Sentinel Score" becomes term people use (next 90 days)

---

## 🎊 You're Ready

**What you have:**
- Complete scoring system
